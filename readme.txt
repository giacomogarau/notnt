a simple 1.20.4 spigot plugin to disable tnt damage to nearby structures, note that other kinds of explosions (such as from creepers or beds placed in the nether) aren't covered here, damage dealt to the player and other mobs is also not disabled

if you're in the future or need support for an old minecraft version editing the dependencies in build.gradle will hopefully be enough
